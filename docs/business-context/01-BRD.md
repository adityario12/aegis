# **Business Requirement Document (BRD)**

**Project Name:** F&B Sales Tracking Dashboard

**Document Status:** Draft

## **1. Executive Summary**

The F&B Sales Tracking Dashboard is a mobile-based solution designed to provide real-time visibility into store performance, inventory levels, and sales targets. The system integrates with the existing POS to display live stock counts and track daily unit sales against predefined targets.

F&B store operators currently lack a centralized way to monitor daily sales performance against targets, leading to reactive decision-making and increased product waste. Without real-time inventory visibility at the point of sale, staff cannot proactively manage stock levels, resulting in either stockouts or expired/unsold products.

This project delivers a Sales Tracking Dashboard that connects to the store's POS system, automatically displays remaining stock units at the point of sale, tracks daily sales against the 10-units-per-product target, and provides stakeholders (owners, managers, cashiers) with actionable insights to optimize revenue and minimize waste within a 3-week timeline.

## **2. Target Audience & User Personas**

* **Persona 1: Store Owner**
  * **Pain Points:** Lack of real-time visibility into store performance; unable to track if daily sales targets are met; concerned about product waste affecting profit margins.
  * **Goals:** Monitor overall revenue performance; receive alerts on waste reduction opportunities; view consolidated reports anytime, anywhere via mobile.

* **Persona 2: Store Manager**
  * **Pain Points:** Difficulty coordinating stock replenishment without real-time data; manual tracking of sales targets is time-consuming and error-prone.
  * **Goals:** Track daily sales vs. targets per product; receive low-stock alerts; manage shift handovers with accurate inventory data; ensure store operates within 7 AM – 10 PM schedule.

* **Persona 3: Cashier / Front-line Staff**
  * **Pain Points:** Uncertainty about remaining stock during customer transactions; no visibility on whether they're meeting daily sales goals.
  * **Goals:** See remaining stock units at POS; complete transactions faster; contribute to meeting daily sales targets.

## **3. Core Business Problem & Proposed Solution**

### **3.1 Problem Statement**

The F&B store currently operates without a unified system to track sales performance against daily targets. Key issues include:

- **No real-time inventory visibility:** Staff cannot see remaining stock during transactions, leading to potential overselling or customer dissatisfaction.
- **Manual target tracking:** The 10-units-per-product daily target is tracked manually, causing delays and inaccuracies.
- **Unmonitored product waste:** Without automated tracking, expired or unsold products go unnoticed until end-of-day counts, resulting in revenue loss.
- **Fragmented reporting:** Store owners and managers lack a single source of truth for performance data, hindering timely business decisions.

### **3.2 Proposed Solution**

A mobile-accessible Sales Tracking Dashboard that integrates with the existing POS system to provide:

- **Real-time inventory display** at the POS showing remaining stock units per product.
- **Automated target tracking** comparing daily sales against the 10-units-per-product goal.
- **Waste reduction insights** by monitoring unsold products and generating alerts before product expiration.
- **Revenue tracking** in USD against predefined targets with visual progress indicators.
- **Role-based access** for owners, managers, and cashiers with appropriate views and permissions.

## **4. In-Scope vs Out-of-Scope (MVP Boundary)**

### **4.1 In-Scope (Must Have for MVP)**

* Real-time stock display at POS (units remaining per product)
* Daily sales dashboard showing units sold vs. 10-unit target per product
* Revenue tracking in USD against daily/weekly targets
* Product waste log (manual entry by staff)
* Mobile application for owners and managers (view-only dashboard)
* POS integration for automated sales data capture
* Store operating hours display (7:00 AM – 10:00 PM context)
* Basic user authentication with role-based views (Owner, Manager, Cashier)

### **4.2 Out-of-Scope (Deferred to Next Phase)**

* Predictive analytics for demand forecasting
* Multi-store/chain management
* Supplier integration for auto-replenishment
* Employee scheduling and shift management
* Customer loyalty program integration
* Payment gateway integration (assumes existing POS handles payments)
* Advanced reporting with custom date ranges and exports

## **5. High-Level Functional Requirements**

1. **Real-Time Stock Display:** The system must display remaining stock units at the POS terminal in real-time to enable cashiers to inform customers and prevent overselling.

2. **Daily Sales Target Tracker:** The system must automatically calculate and display the number of units sold per product against the 10-unit daily target, showing progress as a percentage.

3. **Revenue Dashboard:** The system must track and display total revenue in USD, comparing actuals against predefined revenue targets with visual progress indicators.

4. **Product Waste Logging:** The system must allow staff to log wasted/expired products with reason codes to identify waste patterns and support waste reduction goals.

5. **Mobile Dashboard Access:** The system must provide a mobile-optimized dashboard for owners and managers to view store performance remotely, including sales, targets, and inventory levels.

6. **POS Data Integration:** The system must integrate with the existing POS to automatically capture transaction data, eliminating manual entry and ensuring data accuracy.

7. **Operating Hours Context:** The system must display store operating hours (7:00 AM – 10:00 PM) and track sales performance within the operational timeframe.

## **6. Business Value & Success Metrics (KPIs)**

* **Revenue Model:** Internal operational tool (no direct monetization; value derived from waste reduction and increased sales efficiency)

* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
  1. **Daily Target Achievement Rate:** Percentage of products meeting or exceeding the 10-units-per-day target.
  2. **Waste Reduction Rate:** Percentage decrease in product waste (expired/unsold items) measured over a 30-day period.
  3. **Revenue Target Achievement:** Daily/weekly actual revenue vs. USD target.
  4. **Dashboard Adoption Rate:** Percentage of active users (owners, managers, cashiers) logging into the mobile dashboard at least once per shift.
  5. **Stock Accuracy:** Variance between system-recorded stock and physical counts (target: <2% variance).

---

## **7. Assumptions & Constraints**

### **7.1 Business Assumptions**

* The store already has an existing POS system capable of providing sales data via API or export.
* All target users (owners, managers, cashiers) have access to smartphones for mobile dashboard access.
* Products are tracked at the unit level (not by weight or portion).
* Staff are willing to manually log product waste during the MVP phase.
* Operating hours (7:00 AM – 10:00 PM) are fixed and consistent daily.

### **7.2 Constraints & Limitations**

* **Timeline:** MVP must be delivered within 3 weeks from project kickoff.
* **Platform Scope:** Mobile application focused; desktop web version deferred to future phase.
* **Integration Dependency:** Relies on POS system's ability to provide real-time or near-real-time sales data.
* **Single Store:** Solution is scoped for a single store location; multi-store architecture is out of scope.
* **Language:** Assumed English as the primary language for the interface (subject to confirmation).
